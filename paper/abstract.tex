  Analyzing Android applications for correct security practices such as using permissions, using the SSL API, and potential interface vulnerabilities 
  is a challenging task. This paper presents our tool CRAB-Droid, a python script that builds upon Androguard to carry out a static analysis to identify potential security vulnerabilities in Android applications.
  We analyzed 100 apps from the Google Play Store with the objective of identifying potential security vulnerabilities. We created 5 experiments to test on our 7 research questions we had outlined in the planning stage 
  of our analysis. Our findings ... \#TODO This project shows the significance of developers following best practices when creating Android apps, and the abilities to develop tools to help guide and educate 
  engineers to them. Implementing tools like Androguard and CRAB-Droid to be used in the development process can help to identify potential security vulnerabilities before putting apps into deployment onto the app stores.
  This can help to save time, money, and most of all, user privacy.
