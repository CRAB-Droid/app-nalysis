\subsection{Analysis of Results}

NEEDS to be more specific.\\

Through our experiments, we see that the majority of applications
(out of the 97 we analyzed) contain vulnerabilities within their
code. This indicates improper security practices are at play for 
most of the apps we analyzed.

When considering our sample size as representative of all 
applications on the Google Play store, the rate at which 
vulnerabilites are found is quite alarming. Many applications
available on the market, according to our study, have a significant 
chance of containing a vulnerability that allows for a third-party 
malicious attack.

\subsection{Future Work}
If we were to continue this research in the future, we would 
want to explore some of the following areas. 

First and foremost, we would like to have more thorough experiments. 
Our experiments currently utilize the Androguard library in 
order to parse the apk files and find simple string matches. 
One example is from experiment two, where we search for 
overridden built-in methods. This experiment is fairly simplistic
and could be expanded upon into something where the method 
internals are also automatically checked to view if they are 
forgoing original intended use, making the user vulnerable.

Additionally, we would like to expand our set of Android 
applications to test on. If we were able to test on a larger 
set of apps, this would allow us to draw more accurate 
conclusions and notice more common trends in regards to 
vulnerabilities. This would allow us to develop a more 
comprehensive tool and experiments. 

Finally, instead of just utilizing static analysis, breaking 
into the domain of dynamic analysis could prove to be beneficial 
in seeing how these vulnerabilities can be exploited in real time. 
This would give us a chance to see how our predictions of 
vulnerabilities holds in a test environment of the application 
running. The results could prove valuable to enforce our 
findings and potentially find more vulnerabilities that were 
not found in static analysis.
