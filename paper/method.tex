\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:overview}
This section presents the methodology for how this project sets out to take a set of apps to analyze, create automated experiments to evaluate each app,
and then generate results to view true and false vulnerabilites detected within the apps. 

\subsection{Set of Apps}

\subsection{Experiment Design}

\subsection{Results Generation}

%Overview of Approach (a nice and accessible ``English'' description of
%your approach). Don't forget a niche high-level figure. Our sample
%high-level figure is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:overview}.

%There is sometimes a background section before the overview section. In
%general, you want to try to get your high level figure somewhere between
%pages 2 and 4. It is generally bad to have a figure on the first page
%(but was unavoidable in this sample).

% You may need to move this \begin{figure} ... \end{figure} block around
% in the document to place it in a logical spot in the paper. In
% general, get the figure on the same page as the prose that refers to
% it.
